Based on the active alerts in Netdata Cloud, there are a few key points to note about the state of the nodes and infrastructure:

1. The node named 'postgresql-0' has multiple active alerts, indicating potential issues with its CPU, disk utilization, and load averages.
2. The '10min_cpu_iowait' alert shows a warning status with the latest value at 0.0% and a triggered value of 46.32%. This suggests periods of high CPU iowait time over the last 10 minutes, which could indicate potential performance issues or resource contention.
3. The '10min_disk_utilization' alert shows a warning status with the latest value at 98.2% and a triggered value of 99.62%. This indicates a high percentage of time the 'nvme2n1' disk was busy over the last 10 minutes, potentially leading to slower disk operations or limited disk capacity.
4. The 'load_average_15' and 'load_average_5' alerts both have warning statuses, indicating high system load averages in the last 15 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively. These values are above their triggered threshold values, suggesting potential resource demands exceeding system capacity.

Based on these active alerts, some potential next steps in order of priority could include:

1. Investigating the high CPU iowait time on the 'postgresql-0' node to identify any processes or operations causing the increased wait time. This could involve analyzing system logs, monitoring CPU usage, and potentially optimizing or allocating additional resources to mitigate the issue.
2. Addressing the high disk utilization on the 'nvme2n1' disk. This could involve identifying the cause of increased disk activity, such as excessive I/O operations or storage demands. Optimizing disk usage, offloading data to other storage devices, or upgrading the disk capacity could be necessary actions.
3. Dealing with the high system load averages on the 'postgresql-0' node. Scaling up the infrastructure resources, adding more nodes to distribute the workload, or optimizing the application's performance could help reduce the load on the system and prevent performance degradation or service interruptions.

Overall, addressing these alerts promptly and thoroughly will help ensure the stability and performance of the infrastructure. Regular monitoring and proactive measures to optimize resource usage and capacity planning are recommended to maintain a healthy and resilient system.
