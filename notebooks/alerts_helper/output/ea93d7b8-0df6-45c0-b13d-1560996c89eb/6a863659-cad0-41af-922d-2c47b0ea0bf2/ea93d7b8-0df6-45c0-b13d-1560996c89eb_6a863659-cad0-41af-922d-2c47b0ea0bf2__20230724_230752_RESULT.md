Based on the active alerts in the Netdata Cloud space, there are a few key points to assess the state of the nodes and infrastructure:

1. Postgresql-0 Node:
   - CPU Utilization: There is a warning for high CPU iowait time over the last 10 minutes. The latest value is 0.0, but the triggered value is 46.32%. This indicates that the CPU is experiencing increased wait time, possibly due to high I/O operations.
   - Disk Utilization: Another warning is raised for high disk utilization on the nvme2n1 disk over the last 10 minutes. The latest value is 98.16%, and the triggered value is 99.62%. This suggests that the disk is frequently busy, potentially indicating a bottleneck on the disk.

2. Load Average:
   - There is a warning for the system's fifteen-minute load average. The latest value is 8.96, and the triggered value is 8.69. This implies that the system is experiencing high resource utilization and may be under heavy load.

Based on the above assessment, some potential next steps in order of priority could be:

1. Investigate and mitigate the high disk utilization issue on the nvme2n1 disk. This could involve optimizing disk I/O operations or upgrading the disk to handle the load.

2. Monitor and investigate the CPU iowait time on the Postgresql-0 node. Identify the cause of the high CPU iowait time and take necessary steps to optimize resource usage.

3. Address the high system load average by analyzing the workload and optimizing resource allocation. This could involve load balancing, scaling up resources, or optimizing application performance.

4. Consider reviewing the sysadmin alert group and the recipients of the alerts to ensure relevant personnel are receiving the warnings.

Overall, the current state of the nodes and infrastructure indicates potential performance issues related to CPU iowait time, disk utilization, and system load. Addressing these issues and optimizing resource allocation will help improve the stability and performance of the infrastructure.
