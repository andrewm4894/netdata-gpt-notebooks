Based on the list of active alert instances, it appears that there are multiple warnings across different components of the infrastructure. 

First, there is a warning for high CPU iowait time on the node 'ml-demo-nightly'. The average CPU iowait time over the last 10 minutes is 41.06%, which is above the triggered value of 41.12%.

Second, there are warnings for high disk backlogs on two disks ('ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv' and 'sda') on the same node. The average backlog size for both disks over the last 10 minutes is above the triggered values.

Third, there are warnings for high system load averages on the same node. The one-minute load average is 60.99, which is above the triggered value of 21.59. The five-minute load average is 61.06, which is above the triggered value of 11.01. The fifteen-minute load average is 41.77, which is above the triggered value of 4.29.

Lastly, there are multiple warnings for anomalies in different dimensions of CPU usage, memory usage, and processes. These anomalies are detected based on rolling 5-minute rates and are associated with specific applications or users.

To address these issues and improve the state of the nodes and infrastructure, some potential next steps in order of priority could be:

1. Investigate and resolve the high CPU iowait time by identifying the cause of the increased iowait and optimizing disk or I/O operations if necessary. This could involve checking for any resource-intensive applications or disk bottlenecks.

2. Address the high disk backlogs by analyzing the disk performance and identifying potential bottlenecks. This could involve optimizing disk I/O or considering increasing disk capacity if necessary.

3. Check the system load averages and examine the load patterns over time to understand the cause of the high load. Consider optimizing resource utilization, scaling up resources, or load balancing if needed.

4. Investigate and resolve the anomalies in CPU, memory, and processes usage. This could involve checking the specific applications or users associated with the anomalies, analyzing their resource consumption patterns, and taking appropriate actions such as optimizing application code or adjusting resource allocation.

Overall, it is important to monitor and prioritize these issues based on their impact on system performance, criticality of the affected components, and potential risks or dependencies. Regular monitoring and analysis of the infrastructure can help identify and proactively address such issues before they escalate into critical failures.
