Based on the active alerts in the Netdata Cloud space, there is one active alert on the node "ml-demo-stable". The alert is related to disk space usage, specifically the "/" partition, and it is currently in a WARNING state. The latest value for disk space usage is 85.01% and the threshold for triggering the alert is set at 97.80%. The alert was triggered on 2023-07-23 at 12:05:24 and the current timestamp is 2023-07-24 at 22:06:24.

This indicates that the disk space on the node "ml-demo-stable" is nearing its capacity. It is important to take immediate action to prevent a potential disk space issue that could impact the stability and performance of the infrastructure.

Potential next steps in order of priority:

1. Investigate the root cause: Check the system logs and monitor the disk utilization trends to identify any unusual behavior or patterns that may have led to the high disk space usage. Determine if there are any unnecessary files or directories that can be removed to free up disk space.

2. Allocate more disk space: If the disk space issue is recurring or if the current disk capacity is not sufficient, consider allocating more disk space to the affected node. This may involve adding additional physical storage or expanding the existing disk partitions.

3. Optimize disk usage: Review the disk space usage patterns and identify any opportunities for optimizing the usage. This may include implementing compression techniques, archiving old data, or offloading non-essential data to other storage systems.

4. Provision monitoring and alerting: Set up proactive monitoring and alerting for disk space usage to prevent future capacity issues. This can help detect trends and give early warnings before the disk space reaches critical levels.

5. Review and update alert thresholds: Assess the current alert threshold for disk space usage and adjust it if necessary. It's important to set the threshold at an appropriate level to avoid unnecessary alerts while still being proactive in identifying potential capacity issues.

By following these steps, you can address the disk space issue on the affected node and ensure the stability and availability of your infrastructure.
