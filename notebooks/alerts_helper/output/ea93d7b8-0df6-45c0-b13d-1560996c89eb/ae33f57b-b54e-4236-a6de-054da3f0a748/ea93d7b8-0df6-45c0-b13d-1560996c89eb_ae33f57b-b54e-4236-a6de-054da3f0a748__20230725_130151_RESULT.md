Based on the list of active alerts in Netdata Cloud, there are several key points to consider regarding the state of the nodes and infrastructure:

1. CPU Utilization: There is a warning alert for the average CPU iowait time over the last 10 minutes on the node "ml-demo-nightly". The latest value is 45.98%, exceeding the triggered value of 41.12%.

2. Disk Latency: There are two warning alerts related to disk backlog. One is for the disk "ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv" and the other is for the disk "sda" on the node "ml-demo-nightly". The latest values are 25184.66ms and 23604.71ms respectively, surpassing the triggered values.

3. System Load: There are three warning alerts for different load averages on the node "ml-demo-nightly". The latest values for the one-minute, five-minute, and fifteen-minute load averages are 76.14, 55.49, and 34.42 respectively, all exceeding their respective triggered values.

4. Anomaly Detection: There are several warning alerts related to anomaly rates for different dimensions of CPU, memory, and processes on the node "ml-demo-nightly". These alerts indicate potential irregularities in the behavior of these components.

5. Memory Utilization: There are two warning alerts for memory utilization on the node "ml-demo-nightly". The "ram_available" alert indicates that only 0.80% of estimated RAM is available for userspace processes without swapping, while the "ram_in_use" alert shows that system memory utilization is at 94.46%.

Based on the above observations, some potential next steps in order of priority could be:

1. Investigate and resolve the high CPU iowait time by identifying the cause of the increased wait time and optimizing performance.

2. Address the disk backlog issues by identifying the disks causing the backlog and taking appropriate actions to improve disk performance.

3. Analyze and optimize system load by identifying the processes causing high load and optimizing resource usage.

4. Investigate the anomaly detection alerts to understand the reasons behind the anomalous behavior and take appropriate actions to mitigate any issues.

5. Opt
