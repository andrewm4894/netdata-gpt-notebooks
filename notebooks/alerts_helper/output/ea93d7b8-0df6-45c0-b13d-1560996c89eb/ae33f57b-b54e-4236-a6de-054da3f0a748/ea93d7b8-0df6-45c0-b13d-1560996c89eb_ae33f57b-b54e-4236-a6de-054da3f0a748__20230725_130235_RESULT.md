Based on the list of active alert instances, it can be assessed that the state of the nodes and infrastructure is experiencing various issues. 

1. The CPU utilization is high, with the "10min_cpu_iowait" alert indicating an average CPU iowait time of 45.98% over the last 10 minutes. This may indicate a potential performance bottleneck.
2. The disk backlog is also high, as shown by the "10min_disk_backlog" alerts for both the "ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv" disk and the "sda" disk. The average backlog sizes are 25184.66 ms and 23604.71 ms respectively, indicating potential disk performance issues.
3. The system load averages (1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute) are also above normal levels, as indicated by the "load_average_1", "load_average_5", and "load_average_15" alerts.
4. There are multiple "rolling 5min anomaly rate" alerts for different CPU and memory dimensions of the "apps" and "users" processes. These may indicate abnormal behavior or potential issues within these processes.

Based on the priority, some potential next steps to address these issues are:

1. Investigate and optimize CPU usage to reduce iowait time and improve overall performance.
2. Address the disk backlog issues by analyzing disk performance and potentially optimizing disk IO operations.
3. Monitor and optimize the system load by identifying any processes or applications causing high loads and optimizing their resource usage.
4. Analyze the anomalies in CPU and memory usage of the "apps" and "users" processes to identify any abnormal behavior and take appropriate actions to resolve them.

These steps should help to improve the overall performance and stability of the nodes and infrastructure.
