{"chart_id": "netdata.dbengine_main_waste_events", "chart_description": "The Netdata main Waste Events chart displays the number of waste events for the eviction and flushing of spins (units: events/s) in the dbengine main cache family, which controls the in-memory key-value store responsible for handling database hash tables, and optimizes their memory usage for efficiency. High values for the waste events can indicate that the cache size may be too small or that there are performance issues with the cache.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"evict spins": "The number of times that an item was evicted from memory by the cache as a result of its tenure ending or its memory becoming scarce.", "flush spins": "The number of times that the cache wrote items back to a storage device or database, typically to help optimize or reduce the memory footprint of the cache, or to free up space for newer data."}]}
