{"chart_id": "windows.logical_disk_latency", "chart_description": "This chart gives an average read/write latency of logical disks in seconds. It helps to monitor disk performance by indicating the time taken by the system to read/write data on a logical disk. Higher latency time indicates slow disk performance, which can impact overall system performance.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"read": "This dimension shows the average read latency of logical disks in seconds. It indicates the time taken by the system to read data from a logical disk.", "write": "This dimension shows the average write latency of logical disks in seconds. It indicates the time taken by the system to write data on a logical disk."}]}
