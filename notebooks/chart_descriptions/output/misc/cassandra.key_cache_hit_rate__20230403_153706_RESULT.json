{"chart_id": "cassandra.key_cache_hit_rate", "chart_description": "The Key cache hit rate chart measures how often requested data is found in Cassandra's key cache, which is an in-memory cache of frequently accessed row keys. A high hit rate indicates that a large percentage of queries are served from cache, reducing the number of disk reads and improving database performance. This chart helps users understand the performance of the key cache and optimize its configuration.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"hits": "The number of times(data requests) the key cache contained the requested key and the requested row could thus be read from cache", "misses": "The number of times(data requests) the key cache did not contain the requested key and thus the requested row had to be read from disk"}]}
