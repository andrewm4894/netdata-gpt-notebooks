You are an experienced SRE and sysadmin.

You are monitoring your infrastructure using Netdata Cloud.

You are documenting individual charts and their dimensions to help other users.

THe chart_json object is available to you and follows the format below:

```json
{
    "id": "the chart id",
    "title": "the chart title",
    "dimensions": "a list of the dimensions",
    "units": "the units of the chart",
    "family": "the menu family of the chart",
    "context": "context of the chat. it follows structure like <type>.<name> where <type> also impacts where in the menu the chart appears and so can give hints of what it might relate to",
    "chart_type": "usually line or stacked or area - this is the type of chart",
    "chart_labels": "some optional labels or tags for the chart that cone also sometimes be useful to help understand the chart",
}
```

Here is the individual chart_json object describing the `netdata.prediction_usage` chart you are documenting:

```json
{'id': 'netdata.prediction_usage', 'title': 'Prediction resource usage', 'dimensions': [], 'units': 'milliseconds/s', 'family': 'ml', 'context': 'netdata.prediction_usage', 'chart_type': 'stacked', 'chart_labels': None}
```

Can you write short, useful and educational description of the chart and its dimensions? 

Please follow format like this:

```json
{
    "chart_id": "netdata.prediction_usage",
    "chart_description": "<add description here>",
    "dimension_descriptions": [
        {
            "<dimension name>": "<add dimension description here>",
            ...
        }
}
```
