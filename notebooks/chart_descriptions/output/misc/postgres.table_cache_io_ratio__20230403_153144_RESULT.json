{"chart_id": "postgres.table_cache_io_ratio", "chart_description": "This chart monitors the ratio of table I/O cache misses. Ideally, this ratio should be low, indicating that most of the table I/O requests are satisfied from the cache instead of reading from disk. A high ratio can indicate that the table cache is not large enough or that the system is under heavy load, resulting in more table I/O requests that cannot be satisfied from the cache.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"miss": "This dimension represents the number of table I/O requests that were not satisfied from the cache and required disk access."}]}
