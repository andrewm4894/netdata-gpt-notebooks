{"chart_id": "cassandra.key_cache_size", "chart_description": "The `cassandra.key_cache_size` chart monitors the amount of memory used by the Cassandra key cache. It helps to ensure that the key cache size remains healthy and within acceptable limits, avoiding cache misses that result in additional disk I/O and latency in accessing frequently queried data.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"size": "The `size` dimension represents the size of the key cache in bytes. It indicates the amount of memory reserved for storing frequently accessed Cassandra rows in memory for faster retrieval."}]}
