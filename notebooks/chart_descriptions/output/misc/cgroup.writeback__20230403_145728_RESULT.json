Writeback memory represents the amount of data that is being written to disk but is still stored in memory for performance reasons. High writeback memory usage can indicate a system bottleneck, and may affect overall system performance and responsiveness.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"dirty": "The amount of dirty memory in the cgroup system. Dirty memory refers to memory that has been modified but not yet written to disk. This dimension can help identify how much memory is currently being modified and waiting to be written to disk.", "writeback": "The amount of writeback memory in the cgroup system. Writeback memory refers to the amount of data that is being written to disk but is still stored in memory for performance reasons. This dimension can help identify how much data is currently being written to disk but not yet flushed to disk."}]}
