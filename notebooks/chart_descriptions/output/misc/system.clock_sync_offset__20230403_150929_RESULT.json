{"chart_id": "system.clock_sync_offset", "chart_description": "This chart displays the computed time offset between the local system and a reference clock. It is useful for determining if the system's clock is synchronized with an accurate reference clock, which is important for accurate time-stamping of events.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"offset": "The time offset in milliseconds between the local system clock and the reference clock. A positive offset means the local clock is ahead of the reference clock, while a negative offset means it is behind."}]}
