{"chart_id": "netdata.dbengine_extent_cache_workers", "chart_description": "This chart displays the number of workers performing various tasks related to the extent cache of the Netdata database engine. The extent cache is the in-memory storage of the most frequently accessed data rows.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"adders": "The number of workers adding new extents to the cache.", "evictors": "The number of workers removing extents from the cache due to memory pressure or because they are no longer frequently accessed.", "flushers": "The number of workers flushing extents from the cache to disk to persist them, either because they are dirty or because the cache is being downsized. These workers are also responsible for syncing dirty extents with replica nodes if replication is enabled.", "hot2dirty": "The number of workers moving extents from the hot cache to the dirty cache, where they are marked as dirty, to make room for more frequently accessed extents.", "jv2_flushers": "The number of workers responsible for flushing extents from the JV2 cache to disk. JV2 is a storage optimization that compresses and deduplicates data rows.", "searchers": "The number of workers searching for extents in the cache that contain a particular range of data rows. Search requests come from Netdata's online tools, such as the dashboard or API."}]}
