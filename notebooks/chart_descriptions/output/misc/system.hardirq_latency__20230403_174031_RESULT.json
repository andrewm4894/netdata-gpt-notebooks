    "chart_description": "This chart shows the latency time of hardware interrupts (IRQ). A hardware interrupt is a signal that is sent to the CPU from a device or a hardware component, notifying the CPU that it requires attention. This chart helps to identify the performance impact of system hardware on overall system performance.",
