{"chart_id": "ad.dra_replication_sync_objects_remaining", "chart_description": "This chart shows the number of AD replication objects remaining to be synced in a full sync for the specified inbound connection on the DRA (Directory Replication Agent) server. A full sync occurs when the sync between two domain controllers has not occurred in a long time or the data on the source domain controller is outdated compared to the destination controller. This chart can help you monitor the progress of the full sync and identify potential issues or bottlenecks during the replication process.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"inbound": "The inbound replication connection on which the sync objects remaining to be synced are being monitored. This dimension corresponds to the source domain controller from which the sync is initiated."}]}
