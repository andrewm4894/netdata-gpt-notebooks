{"chart_id": "system.hardirq_latency", "chart_description": "This chart displays the latency time of hardware IRQs in milliseconds. It helps monitor the performance of hardware interrupts on the system and identify any potential bottlenecks. The chart is stacked, meaning that the total latency time is divided into segments representing the dimensions (drivers or devices) that generate interrupts.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"ata_piix": "This dimension represents the latency time of the Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) controller interrupt handler.", "local_timer": "This dimension represents the latency time of the local timer interrupt handler.", "virtio0": "This dimension represents the latency time of the Virtual I/O device interrupt handler for the first disk controller.", "virtio2-input.0": "This dimension represents the latency time of the Virtual I/O device interrupt handler for the first input controller."}]}
