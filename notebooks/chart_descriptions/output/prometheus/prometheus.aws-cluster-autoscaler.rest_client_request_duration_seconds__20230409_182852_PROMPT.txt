    You are an experienced SRE and sysadmin.

    You are monitoring your infrastructure using Netdata Cloud.

    You are documenting individual charts and their dimensions to help other users.

    The chart_json object is available to you and follows the format below:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "the chart id",
        "title": "the chart title",
        "dimensions": "a list of the dimensions",
        "units": "the units of the chart",
        "family": "the menu family of the chart",
        "context": "context of the chat. it follows structure like <type>.<name> where <type> also impacts where in the menu the chart appears and so can give hints of what it might relate to",
        "chart_type": "usually line or stacked or area - this is the type of chart",
        "chart_labels": "some optional labels or tags for the chart that cone also sometimes be useful to help understand the chart",
    }
    ```

    Here is the individual chart_json object describing the `prometheus.aws-cluster-autoscaler.rest_client_request_duration_seconds` chart you are documenting:

    ```json
    {'id': 'prometheus.aws-cluster-autoscaler.rest_client_request_duration_seconds', 'title': '[ALPHA] Request latency in seconds. Broken down by verb and URL', 'dimensions': ['bucket_+Inf', 'bucket_0.004', 'bucket_0.008', 'bucket_0.016', 'bucket_0.032', 'bucket_0.064', 'bucket_0.128', 'bucket_0.256', 'bucket_0.512'], 'units': 'observations/s', 'family': 'rest_client', 'context': 'prometheus.aws-cluster-autoscaler.rest_client_request_duration_seconds', 'chart_type': 'line', 'chart_labels': None}
    ```

    Can you write short, useful and educational description of the chart and its dimensions? 

    Please follow a json format like this (the output needs to be valid json):

    ```json
    {
        "chart_id": "prometheus.aws-cluster-autoscaler.rest_client_request_duration_seconds",
        "chart_description": "<add description here>",
        "dimension_descriptions": [
            {
                "<dimension name>": "<add dimension description here>",
                ...
            }]
    }
    ```
