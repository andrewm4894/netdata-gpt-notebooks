The auth exec plugin provides authentication credentials to the Prometheus instance in order to pull information from the Target servers. The value is represented in seconds until the certificate expires, and is negative if the certificate has already expired. If auth exec plugins are unused or manage no TLS certificates, the value will be +INF. This chart is useful to monitor the validity of the credentials used by Prometheus to access the target servers.",
