{"chart_id": "system.clock_status", "chart_description": "The System Clock Status chart provides information on the synchronization status of the system clock. It displays the number of clock errors and unsynchronized clock events that have occurred over time.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"clockerr": "The number of clock errors detected by the system clock. A clock error occurs when the system clock drifts too far from the reference clock, resulting in inaccurate timekeeping.", "unsync": "The number of times the system clock has become unsynchronized with the reference clock. An unsynchronized clock occurs when the system clock and reference clock have a time difference outside of acceptable limits."}]}
