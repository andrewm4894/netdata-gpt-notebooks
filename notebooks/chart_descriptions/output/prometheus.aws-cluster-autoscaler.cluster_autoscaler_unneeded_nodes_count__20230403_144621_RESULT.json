{"chart_id": "prometheus.aws-cluster-autoscaler.cluster_autoscaler_unneeded_nodes_count", "chart_description": "This chart shows the number of nodes that are currently considered unneeded by the Cluster Autoscaler (CA) in an AWS cluster. The Cluster Autoscaler is responsible for scaling nodes up or down based on the current demand of the cluster. When there are not enough pods to assign to a node, the CA considers it unneeded and terminates it.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"cluster_autoscaler_unneeded_nodes_count": "This dimension represents the number of unneeded nodes. A high value can indicate that the CA is not functioning optimally, while a low value can suggest the opposite."}]}
