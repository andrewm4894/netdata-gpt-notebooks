    "chart_description": "The `mem.pgfaults` chart displays the number of faults per second caused by memory page faults in the system. Page faults occur when a process attempts to access a page of memory that is not currently in physical memory, causing the system to retrieve the page from the disk. A high number of page faults can indicate that the system is experiencing memory pressure and may benefit from additional memory resources.",
