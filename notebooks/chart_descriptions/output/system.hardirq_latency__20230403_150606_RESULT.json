{"chart_id": "system.hardirq_latency", "chart_description": "This chart shows the latency of Hardware interrupts (IRQs) in milliseconds on the system. IRQs are used by hardware devices to request attention from the processor, and high latency can indicate performance issues or hardware bottlenecks. This chart allows users to monitor and diagnose IRQ latency for specific dimensions and devices.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"ata_piix": "The latency of ATA Piix devices", "func_call_single": "The latency of single function calls", "local_timer": "The latency of local timers on the system", "virtio0": "The latency of Virtio 0 devices"}]}
