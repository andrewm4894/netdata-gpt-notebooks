    "chart_description": "The `services.cpu` chart shows the CPU utilization percentage for various systemd services running on the system. The values are displayed as a stacked chart, with each service represented as a separate stack. The total height of the stacks represents the total CPU usage of all the services combined. The chart is useful for identifying any service that may be consuming too much CPU resources and causing system performance issues.",
