    "chart_description": "The CPU softirqs chart shows the number of times per second that each type of softirq was serviced by the CPU. SoftIRQs are software interrupts triggered by kernel space drivers and are typically used to handle time-sensitive I/O operations or to schedule deferred work. This chart helps identify potential bottlenecks in the kernel, as excessive softirq activity can lead to increased system overhead and reduced performance.",
