    "chart_description": "The residual frequency chart shows the difference between the measured frequency and the ideal frequency, for the Chrony service. A positive residual frequency means the system is running slow, while a negative residual frequency means the system is running fast. This chart is important for monitoring time synchronization accuracy and detecting issues with the Chrony service.",
