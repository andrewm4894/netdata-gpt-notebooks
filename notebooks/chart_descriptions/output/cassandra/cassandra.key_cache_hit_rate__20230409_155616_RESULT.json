    "chart_description": "This chart displays the performance of the Cassandra key cache in terms of cache hit rate. The key cache stores frequently-accessed data in memory to speed up read operations. A higher hit rate indicates better performance, while a lower hit rate may indicate that the cache is not being utilized effectively.",
