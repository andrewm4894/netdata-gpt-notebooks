    "chart_description": "This chart tracks the rate of completed compactions in tasks per second for the Cassandra database system. Compactions are the process of merging multiple SSTables (sorted string tables) into a larger one to improve read performance. This chart can be used to monitor the effectiveness of the compaction process and detect any bottlenecks that may be affecting performance.",
