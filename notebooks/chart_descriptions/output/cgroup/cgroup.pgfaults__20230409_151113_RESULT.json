    "chart_description": "This chart is used to monitor the memory page faults of a specific control group (cgroup). When a process attempts to access a page of memory that is not currently in physical RAM, it results in a page fault. If the page is not found in the memory cache, it is retrieved from the hard disk. This process can result in a major page fault which is much more expensive.",
