    "chart_description": "The `windows.net_nic_discarded` chart measures the number of discard packets per second on a network interface card (NIC) in a Windows system. Discard packets occur when a packet is dropped due to lack of buffer space or when a packet arrives on a NIC that is congested or for which the packet is not addressed. This chart provides information about potential network bottlenecks and can help diagnose network performance issues.",
