    "chart_description": "The Write-Ahead Log (WAL) is a standard feature of PostgreSQL used to ensure data durability. It consists of a series of files that log changes made to the database. This chart shows the rate at which data is being written to the WAL. A spike in this rate may indicate a high volume of write operations, while a sustained high rate may suggest a problem with the WAL or file system performance.",
