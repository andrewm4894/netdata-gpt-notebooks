    "chart_description": "This chart shows the amount of time a processor is stalled due to full CPU pressure. Full CPU pressure is when all cores of the CPU are actively performing work and unable to handle any more requests, resulting in bottlenecks and slower performance. A higher value on this chart indicates that the CPU is experiencing more pressure and may need to be upgraded or optimized.",
