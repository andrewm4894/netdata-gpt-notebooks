    "chart_description": "This chart shows the percentage distribution of latencies for Data Encryption Key(DEK) Generation Operations in Kubernetes API Server. These latencies indicate the time taken by the API server to generate a new DEK for storing secrets in etcd datastore. Higher percentage values in a specific latency range may indicate potential bottlenecks or performance issues in API server - etcd communication or etcd storage.",
