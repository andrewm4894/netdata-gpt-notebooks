    "chart_description": "The Netdata API Responses Compression Savings Ratio chart measures the compression savings achieved by the Netdata API responses in percentage. A high compression savings ratio indicates that Netdata is efficient in compressing the API responses, which reduces network bandwidth and improves the API's response time.",
