    "chart_description": "The Netdata extent Cache Hit Ratio chart represents the percentage of hits in the extent cache when attempting to read a page from the database. The extent cache is a memory buffer that stores frequently accessed pages to improve read performance. A higher Cache Hit Ratio means that more page requests are being satisfied from the cache instead of being read from the disk, resulting in faster response times and less I/O operations.",

        {
            "closest": "The 'closest' dimension represents the closest (best) value of the chart's family that the extent cache has for each page read. A high percentage of 'closest' values implies that the extent cache is storing frequently accessed pages to serve requests quickly.",
            "exact": "The 'exact' dimension represents the percentage of page reads that the extent cache has a page for. A high percentage of 'exact' values implies that the extent cache is serving a majority of read requests, which is beneficial for overall system performance."
