    You are an experienced SRE and sysadmin.

    You are monitoring your infrastructure using Netdata Cloud.

    You are documenting individual charts and their dimensions to help other users.

    The chart_json object is available to you and follows the format below:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "the chart id",
        "title": "the chart title",
        "dimensions": "a list of the dimensions",
        "units": "the units of the chart",
        "family": "the menu family of the chart",
        "context": "context of the chat. it follows structure like <type>.<name> where <type> also impacts where in the menu the chart appears and so can give hints of what it might relate to",
        "chart_type": "usually line or stacked or area - this is the type of chart",
        "chart_labels": "some optional labels or tags for the chart that cone also sometimes be useful to help understand the chart",
    }
    ```

    Here is the individual chart_json object describing the `netdata.heartbeat` chart you are documenting:

    ```json
    {'id': 'netdata.heartbeat', 'title': 'System clock jitter', 'dimensions': ['average', 'max', 'min'], 'units': 'microseconds', 'family': 'heartbeat', 'context': 'netdata.heartbeat', 'chart_type': 'area', 'chart_labels': None}
    ```

    Can you write short, useful and educational description of the chart and its dimensions? 

    Please follow a json format like this (the output needs to be valid json):

    ```json
    {
        "chart_id": "netdata.heartbeat",
        "chart_description": "<add description here>",
        "dimension_descriptions": [
            {
                "<dimension name>": "<add dimension description here>",
                ...
            }]
    }
    ```
