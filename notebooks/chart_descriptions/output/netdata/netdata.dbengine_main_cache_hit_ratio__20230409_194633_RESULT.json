    "chart_description": "The Netdata main Cache Hit Ratio chart shows the percentage of cache hits for the main database engine. This metric is a key performance indicator for database performance as a high cache hit ratio indicates that database requests are being fulfilled from cache memory rather than having to access disk storage.",
