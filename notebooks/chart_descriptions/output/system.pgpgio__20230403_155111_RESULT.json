{"chart_id": "system.pgpgio", "chart_description": "The Memory Paged from/to disk chart measures the number of kilobytes per second that are read from or written to the disk. This indicates the amount of memory that is being swapped in/out from/to the disk. When this chart shows high values for the 'in' dimension, it can indicate that the server needs more memory or that memory-intensive processes are running. When the 'out' dimension has high values, it can indicate that processes are writing to the disk more than they should, which can cause disk I/O bottlenecks.", "dimension_descriptions": [{"in": "The number of kilobytes per second that are read from the disk to memory.
