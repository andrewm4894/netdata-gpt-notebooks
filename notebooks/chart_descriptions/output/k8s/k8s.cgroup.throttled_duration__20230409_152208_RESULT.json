    "chart_description": "This chart measures the duration of CPU throttling for containers deployed in a Kubernetes cluster. CPU throttling occurs when a container is consuming more CPU resources than it has been allocated, and it is a mechanism to limit the container's resource usage to its allocated share. This chart helps to identify if a container is experiencing resource constraints and if adjustments need to be made to its resource allocation or application settings to optimize its performance.",
